## Overview

The **Chair of Informatics for Medical Technologies (CIMT)** develops mathematically rigorous and data-driven methods for the analysis of multimodal neurophysiological and neuroimaging signals. Our research bridges **signal processing**, **biomedical statistics**, **network neuroscience**, and **machine learning** to uncover robust biomarkers of neurological and motor system function in health and disease.

We focus on **reproducible**, **open**, and **clinically translatable** computational pipelines for:
- Resting-state and task-based **fMRI**, **EEG**, **MEG**, and **EMG**
- **Structural MRI** and **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)**
- **PET**-based functional network mapping
- **Sleep neurophysiology** and **oscillatory dynamics**
- **Central motor system** function and pathology

Our work supports applications in neurology, movement disorders, and digital biomarker discovery.

## Core Methodologies

| Domain | Methods |
|--------|---------|
| **Time Series Analysis** | Time‚Äìfrequency decomposition, phase-amplitude coupling, spectral estimation, non-stationary modeling |
| **Source Imaging** | Beamforming (e.g., LCMV), dipole fitting, coregistration with anatomical priors |
| **Functional & Effective Connectivity** | WPLI, debiased estimators, Granger causality, graph-theoretical network metrics |
| **Multimodal Integration** | Joint modeling of EEG/fMRI, PET/fMRI, DTI/fMRI; cross-modal alignment |
| **Machine Learning** | Deep neural networks (e.g., BBTransformer), interpretable models for clinical trait prediction |
| **Biomedical Statistics** | Confounder-aware modeling (age, sex, motion), permutation testing, effect size estimation |

## Open Research Tools

We provide a suite of open-source, containerized tools for end-to-end neurosignal analysis‚Äîhosted on Hugging Face Spaces:

| Tool | Purpose | Link |
|------|--------|------|
| **ICA_Xtra** | Automated ICA-based artifact removal for high-density EEG (e.g., 280-channel EGI) | [Run on HF](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/ICA_Xtra) |
| **LCMV_Xtra** | Enhanced LCMV beamformer for source-level neural activity reconstruction | [Run on HF](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/LCMV_Xtra) |
| **FC_Xtra** | Debiased functional connectivity (WPLI) using DiFuMo brain parcellation | [Run on HF](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/FC_Xtra) |

All tools are designed for **reproducibility**, **scalability**, and **integration** into larger analysis workflows.
